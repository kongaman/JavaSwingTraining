Udemy - Java Swing (GUI) Programming: From Beginner to Expert by John Purcell

This course teaches you how to create desktop and web-based applications using Java Swing, Java's built-in user interface toolkit. Each tutorial is fairly self-contained; but we'll also build two complete applications step by step along the way, so you can choose either to work through the whole course or to dip in and out.

Among other things we'll look at nearly all Swing widgets, we'll take a look at JDBC for database access, the graphics API, model-view-controller (MVC) architecture, serialization for saving data, the listener-event model and even basic animation.

When you finish the course, you'll be an advanced Swing developer, capable of creating complex and scalable Swing GUI applications.
